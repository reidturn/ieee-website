Our organization has several committees in order to distribute responsibilities appropriately to our members. Each of these committees provide a different opportunity to help IEEE provide its many services and promote networking within the organization.

##Professional Committee
Professional development is one of the most important aspects in an engineerâ€™s career, and for IEEE, that means helping our members find employment and research opportunities. The IEEE Professional Committee works very closely with corporations and professors to organize events and make professional connections. Click [here](corporate/) to learn more.

##Service Committee
The IEEE Service Committee is dedicated to coordinating and planning several community service events in Ann Arbor. Click [here](service/) to learn more.

##Projects Committee
IEEE Projects Committee exists to empower students and allow them to pursue technical projects outside the classroom. IEEE facilitates students by providing access to labs where students can work on the projects during their own time, as well as access to equipment and mentorship.

##Activities Committee
In IEEE, many social and academic events happen throughout each semester. The Activities Committee is responsible for organizing and publicizing new events. It is a strong belief of IEEE that an active community is important to the society and the EECS community as a whole. Click [here](activities/) to learn more.
